# SEO-TRICK-AND-TIPS

On-Page SEO:
Target relevant keywords: Research keywords that people are searching for related to your website's content. Use tools like Google Keyword Planner (part of Google Ads) or Ahrefs (free trial available) to find relevant keywords with good search volume and lower competition.
High-quality, original content: Create informative, engaging, and well-written content that provides value to your readers. Optimize your content for your target keywords by including them naturally throughout the text, but avoid keyword stuffing. Iâ€™ll explain you letter on what is keyword stuffing.
Format for readers and search engines: Use subheadings, bullet points, and images to break up your text and make it easier to read. Include title tags and meta descriptions that accurately reflect the content of your page and are optimized for your target keywords. Aim for titles around 50-60 characters and descriptions around 150-160 characters. 
Technical SEO: Ensure your website is mobile-friendly, has a fast loading speed, and uses a clean and simple code structure. You can use Google Search Console to identify technical SEO issues on your website.

Off-Page SEO:
Backlinks: Backlinks are links from other websites to your website. Getting high-quality backlinks from relevant websites is one of the most important factors in SEO. There are many ways to get backlinks, such as guest blogging, creating infographics, and directory submissions. However, focus on creating high-quality content that others will naturally want to link to.
Social media promotion: Share your content on social media to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to your website.
Backlinks:
Focus on quality over quantity: It's better to have a few high-quality backlinks from relevant websites than many low-quality backlinks.

Broken link building: Find broken links on websites in your niche and suggest your own content as a replacement.
